Initialise a boolean table

// When palindrom is a substring of length 1
set table[i][i] to true

// When palindrome is a substring of length 2
set table[i][i+1] to true

// When palindrome is a substring of length >= 3
initialise an end pointer j, such that it points to the end of the current substring
if char at i == chat at j AND table[i + 1][j - 1] is true, set table[i][j] to true
then the length of the current substring k is said to be the current max length
if k is larger than max length, assign k to a start variable, and update max length

return substring(start, start + max length)
