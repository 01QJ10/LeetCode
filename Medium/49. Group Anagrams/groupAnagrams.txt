The idea is to store the unique groups of characters as keys, and the respective indices with the 
group of characters as values. Since set cannot be stored as key as it is unhashable, we can 
sort each group of characters and store them in tuples, so that the order of the characters
will not matter.

For strs of length n and characters of length m, this will take O(n) + O(m log m), whichever larger will 
dominate.

As the indices were stored as lists, now we just have to use for loops to extract them out and put them
in the desired form, which will also take O(n).
