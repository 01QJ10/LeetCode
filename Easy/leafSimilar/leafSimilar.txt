The objective is to check whether the leaves of two trees form the same array,
hence a simple DFS algorithm will do:
    def dfs:
        if (stopping condition):
            return
        dfs(root.left)
        dfs(root.right)

The stopping conditions would be these two:
    - check whether the current node is a leaf
    - stop if not a root

Then, we just have to define a list in the dfs(), and add the value of the node if it is a leaf.
