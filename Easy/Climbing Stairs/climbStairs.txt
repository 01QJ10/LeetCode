If we list the solution for the first few cases, it is easy to notice that:
    -n = 1: 1
    -n = 2: 2
    -n = 3: 3
    -n = 4: 5
    -n = 5: 8
The base cases are n = 1, and n = 2, and every subsequent n would be the sum of the previous two.
The recursive solution would be easy to see, i.e.:
    def recursive(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        return recursive(n - 1) + recursive(n - 2)
However, the time limit is exceeded for this solution. Hence, we can simply change this to an iterative solution.
To achieve that, we still need the base case n = 1, and set two variables prev and curr to 1 outside the for loop, 
and a variable temp inside the loop, to keep track of the current value and the previous value.
